## Summary
Primary requirement: Elegant Hawaiian hotel website for Oahu location with comprehensive booking system, user authentication, room showcase, packages, and amenities. Technical approach: React + TypeScript + CSS Modules static webapp with Vite build tool, mock data services for initial implementation, and progressive enhancement architecture ready for future database integration.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.2+ with React 18+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React, React Router v6, Vite (build tool)  
**Storage**: Mock data services in TypeScript (localStorage for user preferences), future database ready  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright (E2E)  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge last 2 versions), mobile-first responsive  
**Project Type**: Web application (frontend static site with mock backend services)  
**Performance Goals**: <3s load time on 3G, <250KB JS bundle, <100KB CSS, Lighthouse >90  
**Constraints**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance, Hawaiian cultural sensitivity, luxury hotel UX standards  
**Scale/Scope**: 5-10 pages, 8 key entities, complete booking flow, user authentication system  

**User Context**: there will be a database but right now mock the data

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### I. Minimal Dependencies ✅
- React (essential framework) - JUSTIFIED: Component-based UI architecture required
- React Router (navigation) - JUSTIFIED: Multi-page application with protected routes
- Vite (build tool) - JUSTIFIED: Fast development and optimized production builds
- TypeScript (type safety) - JUSTIFIED: Large codebase with complex entities
- No additional UI libraries, using CSS Modules for styling

### II. Component-First Architecture ✅
- All UI elements designed as reusable components
- Clear separation: presentational components (RoomCard, PackageCard) vs containers (RoomsList, BookingFlow)
- TypeScript interfaces for all component props
- Independent component testing strategy

### III. Static-First Design ✅
- Core content (rooms, packages, amenities) accessible without JavaScript
- Progressive enhancement for booking functionality and user authentication
- Mock data services simulate static JSON files
- Graceful degradation for advanced features

### IV. Performance Budget ✅
- Target: <250KB JS bundle (React ~45KB, Router ~20KB, app code ~100KB estimated)
- Target: <100KB CSS (CSS Modules with tree-shaking)
- Route-based code splitting planned
- Image optimization and responsive images required
- Critical CSS inlining strategy

### V. Accessibility Compliance ✅
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory for hotel industry
- Semantic HTML5 structure (nav, main, section, article)
- Keyboard navigation for booking flow and user authentication
- Screen reader compatibility for all interactive elements
- Hawaiian cultural content must be accessible to all users

**Initial Constitution Check: PASS** - No violations identified

**Structure Decision**: Web application (frontend static site with mock backend services)

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - Mock data architecture patterns for React applications
   - React Router v6 authentication flow best practices
   - CSS Modules organization for large component libraries
   - TypeScript patterns for hotel booking domain modeling
   - Accessibility patterns for complex booking forms
   - Performance optimization for image-heavy hotel websites

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   Task: "Research mock data architecture patterns for React + TypeScript hotel booking application"
   Task: "Find React Router v6 best practices for protected routes and user authentication"
   Task: "Research CSS Modules organization patterns for component-first architecture"
   Task: "Find TypeScript domain modeling patterns for hotel booking systems"
   Task: "Research WCAG 2.1 AA compliance patterns for booking forms and user authentication"
   Task: "Find performance optimization strategies for image-heavy hotel websites"
   Task: "Research Hawaiian cultural design elements and luxury hotel UX patterns"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all technical decisions documented

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - User, Guest, Room, Booking, Package, Amenity, Property, Session
   - TypeScript interfaces with validation rules
   - Entity relationships and state transitions

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - Authentication endpoints (register, login, logout, reset password)
   - Room availability and details endpoints
   - Package information endpoints  
   - Amenity information endpoints
   - Booking CRUD endpoints
   - User profile management endpoints
   - Mock service implementations

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - Authentication service tests
   - Room service tests
   - Booking service tests
   - User service tests
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Guest browsing and booking flow
   - User registration and login flow
   - Profile management scenarios
   - Booking history scenarios

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with React/Vite patterns
   - Add TypeScript hotel domain patterns
   - Include CSS Modules organization
   - Add accessibility compliance patterns

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each service contract → mock service implementation task [P]
- Each entity → TypeScript interface creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Each component → component implementation task
- Setup tasks: Vite configuration, testing setup, CSS Modules setup

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Types → Services → Components → Pages
- Foundation first: Setup → Models → Services → Components → Pages → Tests
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering:
- Project setup (Vite, TypeScript, testing)
- Data models and service contracts  
- Mock service implementations
- Component library development
- Page implementations
- User authentication flow
- Booking system implementation
- Testing and accessibility validation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*No constitutional violations identified - section remains empty*

## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
